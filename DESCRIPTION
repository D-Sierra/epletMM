Title: Bulk HLA high resolution imputation and eplet analysis
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Daniel Álvarez de la Sierra
Maintainer: Daniel Álvarez de la Sierra <dalvarez@idival.org>
Description: Taking HLA typing data imported from Modulab software functions provided are able to: curate,
    sort and impute high resolution typing for each individual with at least HLA low resolution
    typing for A,B and DRB1 loci; high resolution typing can be used to assign eplet present in each allele, 
    calculate unique eplets for each patient at HLA class I and class II loci; and epletMM allows virtual 
    crossmatch between pairs of donor and recipients to calculate eplet missmatch.
